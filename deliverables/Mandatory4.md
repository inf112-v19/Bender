# Mandatory 4
## Task 1
* Test role: Rune
* Retrospective/Team-wise/project methodology
    * The project board looks cleaner after we added the backlog.
    * The WIP limit on 'in progress' and 'review' works fine, but have'nt had any huge impact on the workflow.
    * Pull requests works great! Everyone gets an overview of all the code in the project. They are also a good place for discussions about implementation details.
    * Get better at making reasonable goals from week to week.  
    * We have focused on creating a rough outline for the project structure instead of jumping straight into implementation.
    * Because of this, we are able to work on different things in paralell and coordinate the tasks easier.
    * We have gotten more used to the roles (teamlead and customer conctact)
    * Get better at deciding what components of the code needs to be implemented first (for other parts of the code to be implemented).
* Group dynamics
    * The group dynamics are great!
* Communication
    * We should let the other people on the team now if we are not attending the group sessions. 
    * Get better at letting the others know if you don't get your tasks completed as agreed.
* Transfer of expertise
    * We have a lot of discussions about implementation details in the group sessions
    * We have written some documentation on things in the wiki (on github)
* Three improvement points
    * Get better at deciding what components of the code needs to be implemented first (for other parts of the code to be implemented).
    * Get better at making reasonable goals from week to week.  
    * We should let the other people on the team now if we are not attending the group sessions. 
* Equal contribution to the code base
    * This works fine.

## Task 2
* MVP (what we think should be done by the submission deadline):
    * singleplayer
    * choose 5 cards
    * move the robot (with some animation)
* Next goal:
    * Finish tiles and make the robot move when on them
    * Several robots/players
